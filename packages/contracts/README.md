# @veydrift/contracts

Foundry Solidity contracts for the first playable Veydrift on-chain MVP targeting Base-compatible EVMs.

## Stack

- Solidity `0.8.28`
- Foundry for build, tests, formatting, scripts
- OpenZeppelin upgradeable contracts
- UUPS implementation behind an ERC1967 proxy

Install dependencies:

```bash
forge install
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your deployer key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The deployer wallet is stored in Vaultwarden under **"Veydrift deployer wallet"**:

- **Address:** `0x87C47Fa2c7747f73E0cA19232615CA4F6B92328c`
- **Networks:** Base Sepolia (testnet) and Base mainnet

## Commands

```bash
forge fmt --check
forge build
forge test
```

From the repository root:

```bash
bun run check:contracts
bun run test:contracts
```

## Contract Model

`VeydriftGame` is an upgradeable MVP contract with one home planet per wallet.

Starting a planet:

- `startPlanet()` costs exactly `0.05 ether` by default.
- The owner can intentionally change the price with `setStartPrice`.
- Each player can create one home planet.
- Coordinates are generated deterministically from chain id, contract address, player, planet id, and attempt.
- The first coordinate model uses `galaxy` 1-9, `system` 1-499, and `position` 1-15 with collision prevention.

Planet state:

- Coordinates, field capacity, temperature, resource multipliers, last settled timestamp
- Ledger resources: metal, crystal, deuterium
- Building levels, defense counts, ship counts
- Player-wide technology levels

Resources:

- Resources accrue lazily and are claimed with `settlePlanet` or `collectResources`.
- Production depends on mine levels, planet multipliers, and available solar energy.
- Storage caps are enforced when resources are settled.

Queues:

- One active building queue per planet
- One active defense queue per planet
- One active ship queue per planet
- One active research queue per player

## Deployment

Scripts require a funded deployer key in the shell environment. Do not commit or print private keys.

Deploy a proxy to Base Sepolia:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=... ADMIN_ADDRESS=0xAdmin forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy \
  --rpc-url "$BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL" --broadcast --verify
```

Deploy to Base mainnet:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=... ADMIN_ADDRESS=0xAdmin forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy \
  --rpc-url "$BASE_MAINNET_RPC_URL" --broadcast --verify
```

`ADMIN_ADDRESS` is optional; if omitted, the deployer address owns the proxy.

Upgrade an existing proxy:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=... PROXY_ADDRESS=0xProxy forge script script/Upgrade.s.sol:Upgrade \
  --rpc-url "$BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL" --broadcast --verify
```

The proxy owner must be the broadcasting account for upgrades.

## MVP Simplifications

This ticket intentionally leaves these systems for later work:

- Colonies beyond the initial home planet
- Resource transport and fleet movement
- Fleet travel, combat, espionage reports, debris fields, moons, alliances, and markets
- NFTs or transferable planet ownership
- Commit-reveal or private-orderflow protections for future hidden fleet intent

The MVP still enforces payment, duplicate-start prevention, coordinate collision prevention, resource costs, one active queue per domain, basic dependencies, owner-gated upgrades/configuration, and timestamp-based lazy settlement.
